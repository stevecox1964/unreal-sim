"""The prompt payload contract — what an APC's mind is allowed to receive (#84).

Before this module there was no interface. The vision path formatted 23 separate
keyword arguments through 18 private renderers; the no-vision fallback ignored all
of that and dumped the raw observation dict as JSON minus exactly one key. Same
runtime state, two different prompts, and a **deny-list of one** — so every engine
field the runtime had ever attached went to the model verbatim, and every new key
leaked by default.

Two rules, and they are the whole module:

1. **Allow-list by construction.** A field reaches the model only if it is named
   in ``ALLOWED_FIELDS``. A new runtime key is invisible until someone adds it
   here on purpose. The default is now "not sent"; it used to be "sent".
2. **No engine identity crosses the boundary.** Actor labels, blueprint class
   names and the engine's own name are lizard-brain vocabulary
   ([[architecture_lizard_brain_sensing]] puts the abstraction boundary at
   *output*). ``check_clean`` is the alarm: it does not rewrite the prompt, it
   reports loudly that one leaked, because silently mangling a prompt is worse
   than a logged defect (rule 12).

Characters are referred to by display name throughout; ``known_characters``
already exposes only display names, and ``_resolve_action_actor_refs`` maps a
name the model emits back to a bound actor. Nothing needs an actor label to work.
