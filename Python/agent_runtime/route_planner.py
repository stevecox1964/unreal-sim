"""Grid-first routing (#17/WP8) — multi-leg travel between grid cells.

A destination several districts away becomes a plan: a straight line of
grid-cell legs, each leg a short navmesh walk the engine can actually do,
ending with a fine-approach that stops at the owned box's edge (B7b-style).
This is the mid-scale between name→position resolution and the engine's local
navmesh walking; without it agents travel greedily by vision and orbit when
the destination isn't in frame (Maren, SR2).

Pure module: no bridge, no LLM, no I/O. The AgentManager caches one route per
agent and calls ``next_waypoint`` on every routed walk; v1 paths are straight
lines by design — obstacle/no-go weighting from sweep data plugs into
``line_cells`` later (#19c).
