"""#85 — shared APC doctrine: rules.md imports.

The bug this guards is not a crash. It is Maren reasoning "time to refuse this
ground" in SR46 and then emitting walk_to, because six weeks of navigation
doctrine had been typed into dufus/rules.md (94 lines) while hers stayed at 21.
So these checks are about *what an agent actually knows*, not about file I/O.
