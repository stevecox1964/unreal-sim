"""Offline tests for the direction bug SR34 exposed (backlog #56).

SR34, cell (6,6): Dufus walked south into a corn field, the survey turned him
through E/S/W/N and left him facing north, and the LLM then said "turn back the
way I came". ``back`` is 180 degrees from the *current facing*, which the survey
had just reset — so it resolved to south and walked him deeper into the corn.
The engine's own rotation log proves it: yaw -114.6 on arrival, 0/90/180/-90
through the survey, and -90 still on the deciding tick.

Three things are pinned here: the survey restores the facing it arrived with,
compass directions resolve to fixed world headings regardless of facing, and
the inbound heading is stated as a fact so retreat is expressible at all.
