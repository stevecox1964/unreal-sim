"""Offline tests for APC-owned place cells (#11.2 minimal slice, WP4).

No Unreal, no network. Run:
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts\\agent_runtime\\test_owned_places.py

Covers:
  - PlaceDB.add_owned_place / find_owned_place / owned_places_in_cell:
    upsert per (col,row,owner,name), exact-beats-substring matching,
    preferred-owner tie-break.
  - AgentManager._resolve_place_target: community name wins; owned place
    resolves to community anchor (cell center) + stored XY offset.
  - AgentManager._record_place: a different name in an already community-named
    cell becomes an owned place (offset from the anchor) instead of being
    dropped; re-naming the same community name creates nothing.
